      <p>In the context of my work, Lumity is an e-commerce company which sells their own unique products. When I joined, there was
      no fixed data function, which was a great opportunity to build and direct it as I considered optimal. The data I worked with
      was mainly sales, financial, marketing and other software engineering tasks.</p>
      <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item-dark">Designed and built the data infrastructure in the form of a MySQL database, by using
        Python to extract, prepare and clean data from multiple external sources and APIs.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item-dark">To manage the data related processes storage I used the AWS infrastructure, mainly EC2
        instances.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item-dark">Provided statistical and predictive insight by using machine learning algorithms about
        topics such as customer interaction, churn rate, marketing attribution modelling, stock/sales forecasts and PR

        Klipfolio, informing on theperformance of the business.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item-dark">The reporting infrastructure is almost completely automatic, with Google Sheets/Klipfolio
        reports being delivered on a daily basis to stakeholders and self updated via the Python based data workflows. Similarly,
        more detailed Excel reports are refreshed on a one-click-refresh basis, leveraging the more recent Excel Data/Power Query M
        language.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item-dark">Built multiple Python applications by leveraging Shopify/ReCharge and other APIs involving
        e-commerce order fulfilment and complex product discounting.</li>

        of the client.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item-dark">The workflow was virtually identical to a normal front and back-end application. Each
        coaching client had a front-end and a database spreadsheet, while one master sheet was able to control, review and plan new
