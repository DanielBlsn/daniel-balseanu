      back and look at any situation from a different perspective. Constantly curious, I ask questions such as: ‘How does it

      mean?’ – Always interested in gaining a deeper level of understanding.</p>

          was no fixed data function, which was a great opportunity to build and direct it as I considered optimal. The data I
          worked with was mainly sales, financial, marketing and other software engineering tasks.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Designed and built the data infrastructure in the form of a MySQL database, by using Python to extract, prepare and

            <li>The reporting infrastructure is almost completely automatic, with Google Sheets/Klipfolio reports being delivered
            on a daily basis to stakeholders and self updated via the Python based data workflows. Similarly, more detailed Excel
            reports are refreshed on a one-click-refresh basis, leveraging the more recent Excel Data/Power Query M language.</li>
            <li>Built multiple Python applications by leveraging Shopify/ReCharge and other APIs involving e-commerce order
            fulfilment and complex product discounting.</li>
            <li>Coordinated the website development team by managing the workload along with deadlines and translated business

            <li>The workflow was virtually identical to a normal front and back-end application. Each coaching client had a
            front-end and a database spreadsheet, while one master sheet was able to control, review and plan new training
            cycles.</li>
